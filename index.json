Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is the leading optimization method for training non-convex models in this setting with a synchronized protocol. However, the assumptions made by FedAvg are not realistic given the heterogeneity of devices. In particular, the volume and distribution of collected data vary in the training process due to different sampling rates of edge devices. The edge devices themselves also vary in their available communication bandwidth and system configurations, such as memory, processor speed, and power requirements. This leads to vastly different training times as well as model/data transfer times. Furthermore, availability issues at edge devices can lead to a lack of contribution from specific edge devices to the federated model. In this paper, we present an Asynchronous Online Federated Learning (ASO-Fed) framework, where the edge devices perform online learning with continuous streaming local data and a central server aggregates model parameters from clients. Our framework updates the central model in an asynchronous manner to tackle the challenges associated with both varying computational loads at heterogeneous edge devices and edge devices that lag behind or dropout. We perform extensive experiments on a simulated benchmark image dataset and three real-world non-IID streaming datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ASO-Fed on converging fast and maintaining good prediction performance.","tags":null,"title":"Asynchronous Online Federated Learning for Edge Devices with Non-IID Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheng Chai","Yujing Chen","Liang Zhao","Yue Cheng","Huzefa Rangwala.\n*(Priprint)*"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602374400,"objectID":"860ce5508cbc1b0d25b107e500020da3","permalink":"https://yujing-chen.github.io/publication/fedat/","publishdate":"2020-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fedat/","section":"publication","summary":"Federated learning (FL) involves training a model over massive distributed devices, while keeping the training data localized. This form of collaborative learning exposes new tradeoffs among model convergence speed, model accuracy, balance across clients, and communication cost, with new challenges including (1) straggler problem, where the clients lag due to data or (computing and network) resource heterogeneity, and (2) communication bottleneck, where a large number of clients communicate their local updates to a central server and bottleneck the server. Many existing FL methods focus on optimizing along only one dimension of the tradeoff space. Existing solutions use asynchronous model updating or tiering-based synchronous mechanisms to tackle the straggler problem. However, the asynchronous methods can easily create a network communication bottleneck, while tiering may introduce biases as tiering favors faster tiers with shorter response latencies. To address these issues, we present FedAT, a novel Federated learning method with Asynchronous Tiers under Non-i.i.d. data. FedAT synergistically combines synchronous intra-tier training and asynchronous cross-tier training. By bridging the synchronous and asynchronous training through tiering, FedAT minimizes the straggler effect with improved convergence speed and test accuracy. FedAT uses a straggler-aware, weighted aggregation heuristic to steer and balance the training for further accuracy improvement. FedAT compresses the uplink and downlink communications using an efficient, polyline-encoding-based compression algorithm, therefore minimizing the communication cost. Results show that FedAT improves the prediction performance by up to 21.09%, and reduces the communication cost by up to 8.5x, compared to state-of-the-art FL methods.","tags":null,"title":"FedAT: A communication-efficient federated learning method with asynchronous tiers under non-iid data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yujing Chen","Huzefa Rangwala.\nIn 2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575849600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575849600,"objectID":"2dcc982e63a9a06b88c58f96e6736f80","permalink":"https://yujing-chen.github.io/publication/matt/","publishdate":"2019-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/matt/","section":"publication","summary":"Sensors and internet of things (IoTs) are ubiquitous in our modern day-to-day living. Applications range from smart home devices that control cooking ranges to mobile phones, wearable devices that serve as fitness trackers and personalized coaches. There is a critical need for the analysis of heterogeneous multivariate temporal data obtained from individual sensors. In this work we show that multi-task learning (MTL) is naturally suited for sensor data learning, and propose a novel multi-task learning approach with attention mechanism, M-Att, that jointly trains classification/regression models from multiple related tasks where data on each task is generated from one or more sensors. The temporal and non-linear relationships underlying the captured data are modeled using a combination of both convolution neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) models. And the attention mechanism seeks to learn shared feature representations across multiple tasks for improving the overall generalizability of the machine learning model. We evaluate our proposed method in both classification and regression settings on an activity recognition dataset and environment monitoring dataset. Comparing the proposed approach to other competitive single-task learning and multi-task learning approaches we demonstrate the high performance of our proposed model with promising results.","tags":null,"title":"Attention-based Multi-task Learning for Sensor Analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Students are especially vulnerable in the initial years of their academic programs; more than 60% of the dropouts occur in the first two years. Therefore, early identification of at-risk students is crucial for a focused intervention if institutions are to support students towards completion. In this paper we developed and evaluated a survival analysis framework for the early identification of students at the risk of dropping out. We compared the performance of survival analysis approaches to other machine learning approaches including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting. The proposed methods show good performance for early prediction of at-risk students and are also able to predict when a student will dropout with high accuracy. We performed a comparative analysis of nine different majors with varying levels of academic rigor, challenge and student body. This study enables advisors and university administrators to intervene in advance to improve student retention.","tags":null,"title":"Running out of stem: a comparative study across stem majors of college students at-risk of dropping out early","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

There is a critical need for analysis of multivariate temporal data obtained from sensors on these devices. Given the heterogeneity of sensor data, individual devices may not have sufficient quality data to learn an effective model. Factors such as skewed/varied data distributions bring more difficulties to the sensor data analytics. In this paper, we propose to leverage multi-task learning with attention mechanism to perform inductive knowledge transfer among related devices and improve generalization performance. We design a novel federated multi-task hierarchical attention model (FATHOM) that jointly trains classification/regression models from multiple distributed devices. The attention mechanism in the proposed model seeks to extract feature representations from inputs and to learn a shared representation across multiple devices to identify key features at each time step. The underlying temporal and nonlinear relationships are modeled using a combination of attention mechanism and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed method outperforms a wide range of competitive baselines in both classification and regression settings on three unbalanced real-world datasets. It also allows for the visual characterization of key features learned at the input task level and the global temporal level.","tags":null,"title":"Federated Multi-task Learning with Hierarchical Attention for Sensor Data Analytics","type":"publication"}]
